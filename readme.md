# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
For my final project, I opted to do a simple portfolio site, showcasing my coding and graphic design 
ability. My intention is to continue to grow this site and project with my career, so that it may 
speak to my talents as I seek employment. With that in mind, I separated my project into separate 
pages and created clean and crisp layouts that would draw the eye while still looking professional. 

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
I created many custom classes for this project. A few of the classes I created are:

1. .header_bg and .header_skew
These classes work together to create the header of my page and give it a slight angle. These classes are 
purely aesthetic. The classes include background colors, positioning, and a transform.

2. .box
I use the box class to pair with my bootstrap columns and provide a visual break between the boxes. This 
class is then amended in my media queries to disappear as the screen gets smaller and the boxes are no 
longer displaying side by side.

3. .section_title 
This class creates the font stylings for each of my section titles throughout the page. It sets the font in a 
uniform fashion - changing the color, sizing, font-family, etc. 


```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. checkForm()
The checkForm() function serves as data validation in my form. It makes sure that the user submits all of the
necessary information and alerts the user when the proper information has not been input. If all of the info
is valid, this function alerts the user that the form has been submitted correctly.

```

## Future Plans
```
In the future, I plan to add PHP form handling so that the form will actually send. I also plan on adding more
to both the coding and graphic design portfolios.
